= Introduction =
This page presents the various ways to interact with MKS

= mkscmapi.jar =
Contains a set of classes (bound using a native library) allowing limited interaction with the mks local client.

Available operations are
 * checkout members
 * add members
 * drop members
 * resync members
 * revert members
 * view member differences
 * view member history
 * view member information
 * view sandbox

All of these actions involve intrusive native-client-owned dialogs.

= CLI interface =

si.exe allows the following operations
