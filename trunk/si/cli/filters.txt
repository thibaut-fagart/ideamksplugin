--filter=filteroptions
allows you to select members for all commands that take a list of members, using filteroptions, which can be one or more of the following:

Note: All filters (except deferred[:rename|:checkin|:add|:drop|:all]) incorrectly show former members.

attribute:name[=value]
selects members based on an attribute name and, optionally, value.

changed [:working|:sync|:newer|:size|:missing|:newmem|:all]
selects changed members based on: changes to working files, those that are out of sync with the project, those where a newer revison exists in the project, or based on all changes.

file:expression
selects members with a specific file name. This allows you to specify wild cards for file naming, such as the asterisk (*) to match any number of characters, and the question mark (?) to match a single character. For example, *.java or *RB.properties would be valid expressions.

frozen
selects frozen members.

label[:name]
selects any member whose member revision has the specified label.

anylabel[:name]
selects any member that contains a revision that has the specified label.

locked[:name]
selects all locked members or those locked by a particular user.

state[:name]
selects members based on state.

format[:text|:binary]
selects members based on storage format.

workingbranch
selects members where the working file is on a branch from a given development path that is not the trunk development path.

Note: This filter applies only to sandboxes.

deferred[:add|:addfromarchive|:checkin|:drop|:import|:rename|:updaterevision|:all]
selects deferred members based on: add, addfromarchive, checkin, drop, import, rename, updaterevision, or all operations.

memberonbranch
shows only members that are off the main development trunk.

unresolvedmerges
selects members affected by unresolved merges.

pending[:add|:addfromarchive|:drop|:import|:renamefrom|:renameto|:update|:updaterevision|:all]
selects pending members based on add, addfromarchive, drop, import, renamefrom, renameto, update, updaterevision, or all operations.

workinprogress
combines the deferred (all), locked (all), and changed (all) filters to select members that are considered work in progress.

Using commas between the filteroptions serves to build logical "OR" statements between them, allowing you to create powerful filters. You may also specify multiple --filter=filteroptions on the command line, which effectively creates logical "AND" statements between them.

For example, you can resynchronize all modified JAVA files through:

si resync --filter=changed --filter=file:*.java

or you can resynchronize all files with label a or b through:

si resync --filter=label:a,label:b
